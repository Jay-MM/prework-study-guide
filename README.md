# <A Study Guide for Bootcamp Spot Coding Bootcamp Prework>

## Description 

My eagerness to learn and curiosity of how things work was the motivation I needed to push me to build a functional web application. I decided to build this project because I have always been fascinated how applications work. Getting the chance to build my own web application before the bootcamp even began is truly an amazing experience. This application allows students to build their own study guide by ensuring they explain important notes about four programming languages. A study guide by students for students is the best way they can explain topics that even they might have struggled with, therefore allowing future students to make better iterations of their own web application themselves. I learned that even the most simplest of projects have many parts working together and many different processes in order to bring that idea into reality.
